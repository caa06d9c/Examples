# Python

This repository has [Echo](./services/echo) server, [SOF-fanatic](./services/sof-fanatic) tool as well as several 
examples that were used at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7370834/dmitrii).

There is a conflict in dependencies, so project has 2 virtual envs, Main and AIO. Only AWS Tools are set to AIO, 
everything else points to project default (Main).
